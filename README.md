# C Sus Sus GUI Encoder

## What is C Sus Sus?

This is a GUI version of the encoder and decoder for C Sus Sus (.sus), which was originally created by YourLocalGDNoob. It is basically an encoder for Python, and originally required 2 Python scripts and specifically named .txt files to encode or decode.

## What is this project?

This is an encoder, created by Doodl0, which includes the functionality of both scripts and more into one file, and with a tkinter GUI to imporve ease of use. It also contains a fix to an unnoticed flaw in YourLocalGDNoob's code. In the original encoder and decoder, there was no number support, meaning you could not write practically any useful code in it.
