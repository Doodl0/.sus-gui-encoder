# C Sus Sus GUI Compiler

## What is C Sus Sus?

This is a GUI version of the compiler and decompiler for C Sus Sus (.sus), which was originally created by YourLocalGDNoob. It is basically an encoder for Python, and originally required 2 Python scripts and specifically named .txt files to compile or decompile.

## What is this project?

This is a compiler, created by Doodl0, which includes the functionality of both scripts and more into one file, and with a tkinter GUI to imporve ease of use. It also contains a fix to an unnoticed flaw in YourLocalGDNoob's code. In the original compiler and decompiler, there was no number support, meaning you could not write practically any useful code in it.

## How does it work?

In the program, you have 2 options. Loading existing code (load .sus .py format, .sus or .py) and saving code made in the text box (.sus or .py). All saved .sus files will be saved to the \sus\ folder in the compiler folder. All saved .py files will be saved to the \py\ folder in the compiler folder. Before saving, however, make sure to use the top text box to give the file a name. To load files, put the name of the file without a file extension in the top text box and press one of the load buttons. .sus files will be loaded from the \sus\ folder and .py files will be loaded from the \py\ folder.
